# Trevor and Ann Marie Intro to VR Final

## Project description

This project is a physics sandbox in VR on the Oculus Rift, centered around buoyancy.  Users can walk around on various floating objects, and can grab the oar and planks scattered around the scene.  There is no particular objective, the intent was instead to give the user the freedom to do what they wanted within the bounds of the simulation.
